This repo is a complete implementation of the paper [Deepstack: Expert-level artificial intelligence in heads-up no-limit poker](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aam6960)

DeepStack, a general-purpose algorithm for a large class of sequential imperfect information games, is the first to beat human pros at heads-up no-limit hold'em poker. This repo implements all of its features, including hand-clustering, turn-river combined solving and GPU acceleration based on libtorch.
